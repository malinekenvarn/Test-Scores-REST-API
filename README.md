This is the first REST API that I built. It is an API that can be used when building an app that manages students test scores. It handles GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH requests when storing a students name, test score and grade in a database.

Background: In my JavaScript basics course we had this code challenge to write a function that takes a test score and match the corresponding grade (A-F). I got the idea to expand this task making a REST API so name, scores and grade can be stored. 

To test the functions I used REST Client to see the results directly in Visual Studio Code. In the future I may build a frontend to interact with this API.
